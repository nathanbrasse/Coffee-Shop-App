# ðŸ“• Coffee Shop App

#### The Library Specialty Coffee
I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but The Library delivered one of the best coffee experiences I've ever had. Right now, they're a small, single-location cafe, but let's imagine they scaled up and wanted a mobile app to match the quality of their in-store service. This project builds a simple database system for The Library that can handle their day to day operations.
